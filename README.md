# Predicting Diabetes Risk with Microsoft Fabric

This project explores an end-to-end machine learning workflow using **Microsoft Fabric**. The dataset comes from Azure Open Datasets and includes various health indicators for diabetes prediction.

## 📌 Objectives
- Load and explore data in Fabric Notebooks
- Preprocess data using Data Wrangler
- Build and evaluate both regression and classification models
- Track models using MLflow
- Save and version the best performing models

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Fabric Notebooks
- Data Wrangler
- MLflow
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, Spark

## 📊 Models
1. **Linear Regression** for predicting blood glucose levels (`Y`)
2. **Logistic Regression** for classifying patients as high or low risk (`Risk`)

## 🔍 Results
- Achieved clean tracking of experiments via MLflow
- Created reusable and versioned ML model artifacts
- Demonstrated how Fabric streamlines the data science lifecycle
